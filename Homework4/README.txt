Homework 4: Projections
=======================

Overview:
---------
This OpenGL program demonstrates 3D scene viewing using both orthogonal and perspective projections, with an additional first-person view mode for scene navigation.

View Modes:
-----------
1) Orthogonal view (overhead slanted view)
2) Perspective view (overhead slanted view)
3) First-person view (use arrow keys to move around)

Key Controls:
-------------
- 'm': Switch between orthogonal, perspective, and first-person modes.
- Arrow Keys:
  - First-person mode: Use arrow keys to move (left/right rotates, up/down moves forward/backward).
- ESC: Exit the program.

How to Build and Run:
---------------------
1. To compile the program, run the following command in the terminal:
    make
2. To execute the program, run the following command after compilation:
    ./hw4
3. To clean up object files and the executable, use:
    make clean

Time to Complete:
-----------------------------
~8-9 hours
